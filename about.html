            <h2>What are the different types of attacks?</h2>
            <li>Phishing - Phishing is the practice of sending fraudulent emails that resemble emails from reputable sources. The aim is to steal sensitive data like credit card numbers and login information. Itâ€™s the most common type of cyber attack. You can help protect yourself through education or a technology solution that filters malicious emails.</li>
            <li>Social Engineering - Social engineering is a tactic that adversaries use to trick you into revealing sensitive information. They can solicit a monetary payment or gain access to your confidential data. Social engineering can be combined with any of the threats listed above to make you more likely to click on links, download malware, or trust a malicious source.</li>
            <li>Ransomware - Ransomware is a type of malicious software. It is designed to extort money by blocking access to files or the computer system until the ransom is paid. Paying the ransom does not guarantee that the files will be recovered or the system restored.</li>
            <li>Malware - Malware is a type of software designed to gain unauthorized access or to cause damage to a computer. </li>
